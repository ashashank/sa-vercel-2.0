  "answer": "The familiarisation exercise is well-structured and covers a broad range of topics relevant to the role. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made: 1. Shorter but More Precise Sample List of Support Tasks: The provided list is extensive, but it can be difficult to gauge which tasks are most applicable to Vercel. Offering a shorter and more relevant sample list of support tasks for the ranking question would help candidates who may not have a clear understanding of typical support tasks at Vercel. This would ensure they can make more informed decisions and demonstrate their prioritization skills effectively. 2. Mock Scenario: Including an optional mock scenario could give candidates a better understanding of the practical aspects of the role. For example, providing a sample Vercel ticket that a client has raised would offer insight into real-world issues they might encounter. 3. Interactive Quizzes: Incorporating interactive components such as quizzes or simulations could make the exercise more engaging and help candidates retain information better. These could be designed to test their knowledge of support-specific questions or general situation-handling techniques. 4. Video Tutorials: Adding short video tutorials that explain key concepts and tasks could cater to different learning styles and provide a more dynamic learning experience. These could cover topics more relevant to Vercel's day-to-day tasks. By incorporating these improvements, the familiarisation exercise can become more comprehensive, interactive, and beneficial for candidates, providing them with a clearer and more practical understanding of their potential role."
