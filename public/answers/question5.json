  "answer": "Encountering a new build issue on an unfamiliar framework can seem daunting, but I'd follow a structured approach to resolve it. First, I'd hit the ground running by researching the framework's documentation, community forums, and internal resources to gain a quick understanding. This initial research should help gather best practices and identify potential solutions. However, if I am still unable to find a solution, I would follow below step-by-step approach: Gather Available Resources: Knowing that troubleshooting might require additional information, I'd gather any relevant resources like error messages, screenshots, or code snippets the customer can provide. This will help pinpoint the specific issue they're facing. Request Error Messages and Other Details: I would ask questions like - - Are you seeing any specific error messages or codes? - If so, could you please share the exact wording or provide screenshots? - Can you describe the environment where you're running the build? - Have there been any recent changes or updates to your system, framework, or codebase that might have led to this issue? Request Steps to Reproduce: Ideally, being a Senior Support Engineer, I should be well aware of the product and should know the steps. I will try to find relevant audit logs via which I can get an idea of what the client did. But if I don’t know and can’t find the steps, I will seek guidance from the developer/engineering team. If none of us can figure out the steps to reproduce, we will draft an email to the client asking for what they tried. Set Up a Test Environment: After obtaining the steps to reproduce, I will set up a test environment. We usually have a test environment where we can replicate issues. Hence, I would follow the steps to see if I can replicate the problem on our test site or if it is specific to the client’s site. This helps determine whether it is a platform-wide issue or specific to this client. This allows me to replicate the problem and isolate the cause. Match with Known Issues: Lastly, if the framework has documented common issues, Id compare the customer’s experience to see if it aligns with any known problems and their solutions. This helps in identifying if the issue is already recognized and if there are established solutions or workarounds. Offer Initial Suggestions or workaround / Escalate: Based on my findings, I would provide initial suggestions for troubleshooting, such as checking specific configurations, updating dependencies, or applying known fixes."
