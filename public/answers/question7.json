  "answer": "Hi [Customer Name], Thank you for reaching out. As per document https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration, to create a redirect from /blog to https://example.com, you can add a redirect rule in your vercel.json configuration file. Below is how you can do the same: 1. Open your vercel.json file. 2. Add the following redirect configuration: (Code formatted using code block extension) {   redirects: [     {       source: /blog,       destination: https://example.com,       permanent: true     }   ] } This configuration will permanently redirect any requests from /blog to https://example.com. Once youâ€™ve added this, (re) deploy your project to apply the changes. If you are using a different hosting environment, please let us know, and we can provide instructions specific to your setup. Best regards, [My name] Decision-Making Process: In crafting this reply, I focused on providing a clear and concise solution tailored specifically for Vercel. - I included the JSON snippet needed to set up the redirect, ensuring that the customer can implement the change with minimal effort. - I chose to use a permanent redirect (308 status code) as this is generally the preferred method for informing browsers and search engines that the content has moved permanently. - Additionally, I offered to provide further assistance if the customer's hosting environment differs, ensuring they feel supported regardless of their setup."
