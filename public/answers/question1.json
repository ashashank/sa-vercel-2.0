  "answer": "My 5 Most Favourite Support Tasks from the list 1. Manage a Support Team I aspire to manage a team in the future, and I believe that managing a support team would allow me to utilize my leadership skills, and I can ensure that the support process runs smoothly and efficiently. I have managed the team as a (shift) lead several times and engineers in the shift were impressed with my helpful nature and fair assignment of tickets. 2. Help Train and Onboard New Support Teammates I enjoy teaching and explaining concepts to others. Helping to train and onboard new team members would allow me to share my knowledge, guide new teammates, and contribute to their professional growth within the company. 3. Work with Engineering Teams During Incidents and Provide Updates to Internal and External Stakeholders I am good at communication and collaboration. Working with engineering teams during incidents would enable me to utilize these skills to provide timely updates to stakeholders and ensure that everyone is informed and aligned during critical situations. 4. Create Video Tutorials to Help Teach Users a Specific Feature or Use Case I am skilled at creating videos with clear communication. Developing video tutorials would allow me to leverage my ability to explain complex concepts in an easy-to-understand manner, and helping users get the most out of our products. 5. Work with the Product Team to Develop a New Feature Based on Feedback from Customers I enjoy collaborating and analyzing needs. Working with the product team to develop new features based on customer feedback would enable me to contribute to the product's improvement, ensuring it meets the users' needs and enhances their overall experience. ======================================================================== My 5 Least Favourite Support Tasks: 1. Engage Multiple Users at Once in a Public Discussion, to Answer Their Questions and Troubleshoot Problems : I prefer to handle issues one at a time to provide quality and focused support. While I can manage multiple discussions, I find that I can give better assistance when addressing issues individually. 2. Dig Through Logs to Troubleshoot a Customer's Broken Project: This task can become repetitive and sometimes monotonous, especially when the logs don't immediately reveal the problem. 3. Respond to 25+ Support Requests via Email Every Day : Responding to a high volume of emails daily can be overwhelming, particularly when some inquiries require in-depth troubleshooting. It can be difficult to manage time effectively and ensure thorough responses for each request. Also, as I mentioned earlier, I would like to provide quality and focused support. Having to respond 25+ Support Requests via email every day might not help here. 4. Respond to Queries on Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, and Other 3rd Party Sites: While I enjoy social media for memes and creative content, the unpredictable nature of these platforms can detract from the ability to focus on actual work tasks. It can be challenging to maintain the necessary focus and consistency in responses. 5. Help Resolve Billing Issues for Customers : This is not my area of expertise. In my experience, billing issues are typically handled by finance professionals within the organization. While I have dealt with them at a basic level, I don't feel confident in providing in-depth assistance, so I consider it one of my least favorite tasks."
