  "answer": "As per the help article - Edge, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware appear to be the serverless functions that run on Vercel's infrastructure. They seem to be a good choice for tasks that require processing data, interacting with databases, or handling user authentication. - Edge Functions: I would use Edge Functions when I need to execute code close to our users to reduce latency. This makes it ideal for tasks that require low latency (fast response times), such as content delivery, image optimization, or basic data manipulation. - Serverless Functions: I would use Serverless Functions for backend logic that doesnâ€™t require proximity to the user. I.e., I'd likely use Serverless Functions for tasks involving data processing, database interactions, or user authentication that don't require super-fast response times. - Edge Middleware: This seems useful for modifying requests before they reach other functions or the server, perhaps for adding security measures or caching data. It runs at the edge network, so I can use it for tasks like adding security headers, caching frequently accessed data, rewriting URLs. For instance, a news website might use Edge Functions to deliver personalized content quickly, an e-commerce platform might use Serverless Functions for order processing, and a SaaS application might use Edge Middleware to add security headers and manage API versioning. By leveraging these tools, Vercel ensures high performance, reduced latency, and enhanced security tailored to specific application needs."
