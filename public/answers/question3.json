  "answer":  "In my current role as a Senior Support Engineer, I recently tackled a challenging scenario where a client's Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality unexpectedly stopped working. Since it was a critical issue impacting their operations, and the engineering team was unavailable due to a national holiday, I knew I needed to take ownership and find a solution. - First, I enabled the SSO by obtaining an updated CERT (after ensuring the CERT was valid) and unblocked the client. Additionally, I wanted to ensure the client received complete information on how the SSO was disabled so suddenly. - Recognizing the limitations of the UI audit logs for identifying the user who disabled SSO, I strategically focused on the Sumo Logic logs. By analyzing these logs, I was able to pinpoint the responsible user. This information provided the client with valuable context to prevent similar occurrences in the future."
